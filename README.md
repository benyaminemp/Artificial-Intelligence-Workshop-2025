# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier – Machine Learning Workshop

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Workshop** led by **Benyamin Ebrahimpour, PhD** at the **University of Portsmouth London**.

This repository contains a **hands-on beginner-level project** that teaches students how **Machine Learning models can classify images of cats and dogs** using Python and TensorFlow.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this workshop and exploring this code, you will:

- ✅ Understand the **basic principles of machine learning**
- ✅ Learn the difference between **supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning**
- ✅ Train a **simple CNN model** to classify images of cats vs dogs
- ✅ Connect machine learning theory to **everyday applications** (e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Google Maps)

## 🚀 Quick Start (Google Colab Friendly)

You can run the code directly in your browser using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com):

1. Click on the notebook file (`Cats-vs-Dogs.ipynb`)
2. Open in Colab and run each cell step by step
3. (Optional) Upload your own image dataset structured like:

```
dataset/
├── cats/
│   ├── cat1.jpg
│   ├── cat2.jpg
├── dogs/
│   ├── dog1.jpg
│   ├── dog2.jpg
```

## 🔍 Real-World Examples of ML (from the workshop)

- **Netflix** recommends shows using supervised learning  
- **Spotify** finds music you might like with unsupervised learning  
- **Robot vacuums / Google Maps** learn better paths with reinforcement learning
